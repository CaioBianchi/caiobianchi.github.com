Canada has long been known as a welcoming and inclusive country—open to people from all walks of life. And for a time, that reputation felt well-earned. But in recent years, the cracks in the system have become impossible to ignore. Poor planning and government complacency have had a serious impact on housing, healthcare, the job market, and almost every other aspect of daily life.

For years, the federal government reassured us that everything was fine—that the economy was “on fire,” that any issues would eventually sort themselves out. Dissenting voices were dismissed or, worse, vilified. Even as frustrations grew, we were told the critics were the problem, not the policies.

Eventually, not even Canada’s largely left-leaning media landscape—one of the most partisan in the world—could continue ignoring what many Canadians had been feeling all along.

Today, young people have little hope of affording a home, crime is spiking in cities that once prided themselves on safety, and families are waiting years just to get a family doctor. Surgeries are being delayed not because of medical complexity, but because we simply don’t have enough healthcare workers—they’ve gone elsewhere, to better-paying systems like in the U.S.

Meanwhile, young Canadians are struggling to find stable employment. The job market hasn’t kept pace with rapid population growth, and grocery bills have surged, with basic items now costing two to three times what they did a decade ago.

And yes, this has been happening for a _decade_.

## So, What Changed?

In 2015, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party formed government and launched one of the most ambitious agendas in Canadian history.

Federal spending skyrocketed, ballooning our national debt to over **$1 trillion**—more than all previous governments combined. The Liberals introduced bail reforms (with NDP support) that, while well-intentioned, have coincided with a sharp rise in property and violent crime.

Since the pandemic, immigration targets have surged, increasing the population by 2–3% annually. That kind of growth is typically seen in some of the fastest-growing countries in the world—not developed economies like ours. While Canada has always benefited from thoughtful, well-managed immigration, this recent acceleration has strained housing, healthcare, and jobs—breaking a long-standing trust Canadians had in the system.

The introduction of the carbon tax has added another layer of frustration. While environmental action is crucial, government reports—including those from StatsCan and the Parliamentary Budget Officer—indicate that the tax hasn’t reduced emissions meaningfully. What it _has_ done is drive up the cost of fuel, which in turn inflates the price of nearly everything else. At times, Canadians were even shamed for taking road trips, as if family time and exploration were environmental sins.

Let’s be clear: **this isn’t about Trump, or any foreign boogeyman**. These are _our_ problems—created by _our_ government.

## Why I'm Writing This

I’m writing this not as an expert, or on behalf of anyone else—but simply as a Canadian who’s deeply concerned about the path we're on. This is my opinion, and it’s entirely your choice whether to agree with it or not. But I believe this moment matters.

We are facing a pivotal federal election. And I hope Canadians seriously ask themselves: **Does it make sense to reward the same government that created these problems, just because they swapped out the face at the top?**

The media may try to paint alternatives as dangerous or divisive—but I ask you to look beyond the headlines. I’ve known Pierre Poilievre personally for years. He’s not perfect—no one in politics is—but he is consistent, principled, and deeply committed to this country. He’s someone who believes in healing divisions, restoring affordability, and bringing accountability back to government.

His wife, Anaida, is a remarkable woman—a mother of two, and an immigrant from Venezuela who understands, firsthand, what it means to escape authoritarian rule and fight for a better future.

By now, you’ve likely heard each party’s platform. I won’t rehash the details. But I will say this: **don’t let anyone convince you that your vote already belongs to them**.

Ask yourself honestly: _Is my life better now than it was ten years ago?_

If the answer is no, then maybe it’s time to try something different. Like it or not, the only party proposing a real course correction in this election is the Conservative Party.

We can’t keep doing the same things and expecting different outcomes. That’s not just unrealistic—it’s the very definition of insanity.
