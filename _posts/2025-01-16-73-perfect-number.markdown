73 is often considered the best number because of its unique mathematical properties. Here’s why:

- 73 is a **prime number** (only divisible by 1 and itself).
- Its **mirror, 37**, is also a prime number.
- The **product of 7 and 3** is **21**, which is the mirror of 12, the position of 73 in the list of prime numbers.
- It’s the **21st prime number**
- **73 in binary (1001001) is a palindrome** (it reads the same forward and backward).
